    <p>I'm a web developer based in Zaragoza, Spain.
     I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
     I have been training myself, but I am currently studying a fullstack web developer bootcamp in Neoland. Besides, I am working as a QA Tester in Hiberus.</p>
